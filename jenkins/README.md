# Jenkins Pipelines
This folder contains pipelines that you can use as a starting point for creating your CI/CD workflows with Kubernetes. The idea is that you see
how a dev/test/QA/production workflow for deveoping your Kubernetes based app, as well as code-driven operational procedures can be captured
in a "devops pipeline-as-code" manner to complement the "infrastructure as code" ideas in the Kubernetes project.

You can easily adapt the (shell) commands in the pipelines to the CI/CD system or other automation of your choice.
